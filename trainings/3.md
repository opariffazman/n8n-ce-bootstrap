### **Hour 3: AI Agent Introduction & Simple Implementation (60 min)**

#### What Are AI Agents? (10 min)
- AI agents as "smart assistants" in workflows
- No coding required - just conversations
- When to use AI vs traditional nodes
- **School examples**: Auto-summarize parent emails, draft responses, extract key information

#### Hands-on Lab 4: Your First AI Agent Workflow (30 min)
**Project: Smart Email Responder**
- Manual trigger (paste parent email text)
- AI Agent node (configure with simple prompt)
  - Prompt: "Summarize this parent email in 2-3 bullet points. Identify: main concern, urgency level (low/medium/high), suggested department to handle"
- Set node (structure the AI output)
- Gmail node (send summary to appropriate staff)
- **Why this is powerful**: AI reads context, you don't write complex rules
- Test with different email scenarios
